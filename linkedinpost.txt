Unlocking the Power of .db Files: Analyzing Stock Data with SQL and Python

Excited to share my latest project with you all! ðŸ“ŠðŸš€

Iâ€™ve been diving deep into the world of data analysis and leveraging the power of .db (SQLite) files combined with SQL and Python to analyze stock data. Hereâ€™s a quick rundown of what Iâ€™ve been up to and why itâ€™s so powerful:

 Why .db Files?

1. Lightweight & Portable: SQLite databases are lightweight, making them perfect for smaller projects or prototyping without the need for a full-fledged database server.
2. Self-Contained: Everything you need is stored in a single file, making data management and sharing a breeze.
3. ACID Compliance: Ensures your transactions are processed reliably, maintaining data integrity.

 The Workflow

1. Setting Up the Database:
   - Using SQLite to create and manage our database schema.
   - Creating tables for storing stock information and historical price data.

2. Data Insertion:
   - Inserting stock details and daily price data fetched from APIs like Alpha Vantage.
   - Using SQL commands in Python to efficiently handle data insertion and ensure data integrity with constraints like UNIQUE keys.

3. Analyzing Data:
   - Running SQL queries directly from Python using libraries like `sqlite3` to filter, aggregate, and analyze stock data.
   - Combining SQLâ€™s powerful querying capabilities with Pythonâ€™s data manipulation and visualization tools (like Pandas and Matplotlib) for deeper insights.

4. Interesting Findings:
   - With this project, I am discovering the correlation between inflation and stock prices. Interesting to note that Microsoft and Apple's prices have gone up with inflation and Tesla prices move opposite to Microsoft and Apple. Nvidia had a stock split, so hard to analyze there. See more details on my [GitHub](https://github.com/firedynasty/db_file).

 Why This Matters

Utilizing .db files with SQL and Python not only streamlines the data analysis process but also empowers you to handle and analyze vast amounts of data efficiently. Whether youâ€™re tracking stock performance or conducting financial analysis, this approach provides a robust framework to derive actionable insights.

 Further Research:

- Trend Analysis: Quickly identify trends over time by querying historical price data.
- Performance Comparison: Compare performance across different stocks or sectors with ease.
- Automated Alerts: Set up automated scripts to alert you of significant price changes or trends.
